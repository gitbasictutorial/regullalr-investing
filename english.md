## Warning

While financial trading markets are no doubt the best to make money through knowledge and thinking, there’s also no other place where people are more severely punished for lack of critical thinking ability.

> Investing is risky, so be careful!

As [Howard Stanley Marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Marks_(investor)) who was listed as 327<sup>th</sup> the most wealthy person in United States in 2017, once said:

> “There are *old* investors, and there are *bold* investors, but there are no *old bold* investors.”

Don’t be so naïve as to believe that you can turn into a superman just because you learned something new yesterday. Translating knowledge into meaninful actions takes much more time than you’ve ever imagined. Relax, take it easy, and don’t rush. You can lift a very heavy weight, but without proper training it won’t be pretty.

## Preface

It’s been ten years since I published *Befriending Time*, and it’s still a bestseller. While I was writing the book, I tried to follow the following principle:

>*Will this book still be useful to readers in ten years?*

While being bestsellers, my books are often perennial sellers. Here are my secrets for writing a book that continues to sell well over time: **simple**, **direct**, **brutal** and **effective**.

Because I have been writing in this simple, direct, brutal and effective way for so long, I have a deep understanding of the following fact: 

> Solving the single most important problem can directly avoid the problems that so many others face.

Actually, most problems in life are due to failing to resolve the most important problem right from the start. If you can handle the most important problem in the beginning, then even though there will still be many other difficulties, they won’t be those eternal problems that so many people face.

Few are essential decisions in life for which many people also ignore the most important problem. For instance, when choosing whom to marry, “Is she or he reasonable?” is always outside the scope of consideration, even though it is the single most important factor. Instead, they focus on appearance, education, background, etc., without considering which factor will be the most important in the future. Of course, maybe this is because they themselves aren’t a reasonable person (yes, it’s true, most people aren’t very reasonable all the way through their lives). 

Because they haven’t eradicated the most important problem, it sprouts like a seed, growing both a tree above ground and a deep root structure below, creating countless new problems. And so we see the same situation: people surround the “problem tree” above ground, wasting lots of time and energy, trying to find ways to solve those “real” problems, which otherwise don’t exist at all if they made the right decision long time ago, working hard in vain.

Another common yet surprising example is most people’s perception on “success”. *Most people see success as an end* , and this misunderstanding leads to countless new problems that could have been avoided if this mistake had been avoided in the beginning. Success is hard to achieve if we see it as an end point, because we will imbue such a final goal with so many unrealistic hopes and fantasies that we will be unlikely to reach it. Even if some people who take success as an end are lucky enough to reach it, the process will make them abnormal. The craziness that follows success, and the result of that craziness, is actually the result of the mistaken belief from years before that success is an end. 

In fact, success is a new start. If you start a business, this is a new start rather than an end. Each time your business raises money from venture capitals, that is also a new start. Even if you go public, that’s still a new start rather than an end, because you have to continue to help the company grow. In fact, the most tragic failure in life is always from perceiving a new start as an end. 

Investment is also one of few the most important decisions in life, but most people haven’t seriously thought about it, let alone make a decision. The investment arena is divided into two extremes. It’s a binary world in which you’re either a 1 or a 0. Either you are extremely successful, or you are not extremely successful, a mediocre like everybody else, which is basically equal to zero. In my view, the existence of this phenomenon is also related to the fact that most people fail to resolve the most important problem at the start.

So what’s the most important concept in the area of investment? **Long-term**.There are more scams in the investment world than in any other area. Why? Because people who have not deeply understood the important concept of “long-term” are always confronting their “problem tree”. Each leaf on the tree is a “real” problem that they must solve, and each branch is something bigger that they need to think about. Not to mention the roots underground, which are so mysterious that they will never understand. In fact, though, this tree should not even exist.

There is a huge gap between thinking and doing, between knowing and making right dicisions, and long-term practice is the only way to cross this gap. A strategy of **regular investing** is the simplest way to practice investing, as all you have to do is regularly purchase a set investment over the long term. However, simple itself always doesn’t necessarily mean easy.

In Greek mythology, there is an island inhabited by the beautiful Sirens. Their incomparable appearance and voices caused passing sailers to lose their minds and crash into the rocks. Only two heroes were able to safely pass. The first was Orpheus, who played the lyre so beautifully that it drowned out the voices of the sirens. The second was Odysseus, who used wax to plug his sailors’ ears, and ordered them to tie him to the ship’s mast, because he wanted to hear the Siren’s song that he knew he would be unable to resist.

The regular investing strategy is correct, but the target for regular investing should be chosen by the readers themselves. In this book I will provide you the tools to make your own decision about what to invest in, by showing you what I’m regularly investing in, and the reasons behind that choice.

*On Regular Investing* is not only an open-source book, it’s also paired with [BOX](https://b.watch), the first zero-fee digital asset ETF, which is my designed. Regular investing is simple, but not necessarily easy, because it’s as if the boat we are sailing is passing by the island of the Sirens. BOX is like the boat, and those who are investing in BOX with us are like the sailors who need to fill their ears with wax, so I’ll keep teaching lessons in the practice group. And I am like Odysseus, tying myself to the mast. Since there are no fees, the way I make money is simple: like everyone else, I am in the same boat, regularly investing in BOX.

We should solve the most important problem in the very beginning, and not let it take root and grow into a problem tree that gives us a plethora of persistent troubles to deal with. This might be the single most important wisdom in life. 

Before long, you will discover that the strategy of regular investing is not only applicable to investing. Actually, it’s applicable to most of life’s important areas, including study, work, and personal life, where the strategy should be used from the very beginning. 

So again, the reason I am writing this book is because I hope that ten, twenty or even thirty years from now its content will still be useful to a lot of people.

## Part One: Regular Investing

Investing is not easy, and successful investing is even harder. But just becasue something is easy doesn't mean there isn't a simple, direct, brutal and effective strategy that almost everyone can correctly master and deploy.

### 1.1 The Strategy and Results

Regular investing is quite simple: 
>Regularly invest a set amount in a particular investment over a long period of time.

For example, **every week** (regularly) for the next **five to ten years**  invest **200 USD** (a set amount) in **[BOX](https://b.watch)** (a particular investment). Of course, you could change BOX to any investment that is worth investing in an holding over a long period of time, like shares in [Apple](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/), [Maotai](https://hk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/600519.SS/), [Coca-Cola](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO), or an [S&P 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500_Index) Index Fund.

Is such a simple strategy really effective? The numbers don't lie.

Suppose you started investing in the S&P 500 on October 8th, 2007. Knowing what we know now, that seems to be the worst time to enter the market, because what immediately followed was the 2008 financial crisis, and it was that day that the stock market began to crash. So if you started investing \$1,000 USD per week on that day...

![Figure01](../images/Figure01.png)

What would the result be? If we take ourselves back to October 8th, 2007, it's really hard to know what the result would be. But if we look at it from today, more than a decade later, the answer is clear: the results were fantastic! We experienced a crash in the market from \$1,561 to a low of \$683, but we kept buying at that low price. Later, the market recovered, and by October of 2019 the S&P 500 had exceeded \$2,960.

But this description is missing an important detail. Figure below shows the value of your total assets (the red line) and the value of your total investment (the blue line). 

![Figure02](../images/Figure02.png)

There is an extended period of time when your asset value drops below your total investments. But towards the end of 2009 the red line passes the blue line, and it almost never again drops below, growing faster over time.

>Note: The historical data in this chart come from [Yahoo Finance (^GSPC)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC), and the chart was created in Google Sheets; you can view the data and spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QE3itAH_TwUv4Gp9EVwwIz3Xb8taT5N-etfJCkYEvrg/edit?usp=sharing).

The key point is that you entered the market at the worst time –- on October 8th, 2007, S&P 500 was at \$1,561, and it didn't return to this price until March 25th, 2013.

![Figure03](../images/Figure03.png)

But if you take another look at Figure before the above, you'll see that the red line crosses the blue line for the first time in 2009. So while it took the S&P 500 **286** weeks to return to its high, your strategy of regular investing began to see steady positive returns after just *111* weeks. When you started to see positive returns, the S&P 500 was still 30% off its all-time high. When the S&P 500 finally returned to its high after 286 weeks, your strategy was already showing returns of *32.64%*.

Let's take a look at an even more striking example. Suppose you started regularly investing in Bitcoin in December of 2017 when Bitcoin was at it's all-time high of \$19,800. Shortly aftwards, the price crashed, and it still hasn't returned to its all-time high. The chart below assumes you started regularly investing in Bitcoin on December 11th, 2017, and kept it up for 87 weeks. 

![Figure04](../images/Figure04.png)

>Note: The historical data above is from [Yahoo Finance (Bitcoin USD)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history/), and the chart was made using Google Sheets. You can view the data and chart [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pzc6p4UhyAMtqaKis2_uU3hbi8Um34ArTiUQr1tZpc0/edit?usp=sharing).

Even though you entered the market at the worst time, your investment has still been profitable in USD terms, with the red line (your assets in USD terms) passing the blue line (your total investment in USD terms) on May 6th, 2009. If you invested \$100 each week, by the 87th week you would have invested \$8,700, but your Bitcoin would have been worth \$16,417, for a gain of **88.71%**. This is despite the fact that Bitcoin remained over 62.85% off of it's all-time high, which was when you started investing. 

This can seem really flabbergasting at first: 
>With regular investing, even if you start at what seems like the worst time, just before a market crash, your overall investment will become profitable **before the market recovers**.

Some fans of regular investing always emphasize a partially correct fact, which is that regular investing will effectively reduce your average cost. But the other side of the coin is that it also probably raises your average cost. It's obvious, isn't it? So these fans are using an incorrect reason to choose the correct strategy . But how long can an operating system with an error at the base level continue to run for?

The reason why regular investing is effective is that **it matches up with the following reality of markets**:

>**Bear markets are much longer than bull markets.**

For example, over the last *one thousand days*, the blockchain markets have had *less than 150 days* of a true bull market. The same phenomenon is true no matter which price chart you are looking at, whether it be the S&P 500, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Tencent, or Alibaba. Bear markets are always very long, and bull markets are always very short. Bull markets are so short that we call them bubbles, like the dotcom bubble at the end of the last century.

Once you understand this key point, you will understand the following; 

>With regular investing, **your profits essentially all come from the bear market!**

Most investors don't understand this, and it is the core reason why their investments are destined to fail. They want to make money quickly in the ephemeral bull market. It's really quite depressing: most of the "investors" who enter the market during a bull market are destined to lose their shirts, because before they realize it, the short bull market has ended, and the long bear market has begun. Regular investors, on the other hand, are slowly accumulating throughout the bear market.

In fact, the strategy of regular investing is not only applicable to trading markets, it's useful in almost all important areas of life, whether it be study, work or family. "Life-long learning" is essentially a regular investing strategy, isn't it? If you could draw a "price curve" for an individual's learning, it would look a lot like the S&P 500. Even though it increases substantially over time, it goes through long periods of flat growth or even drops. Often when you are inviting time in learning something it feels like you would be better off not learning it. The "bear market" is long, isn't it? This explains why so few people are able to become true life-long learners. The reason is the same: everyone wants to make money quickly in the bull market and then leave.

[Jeff Bezos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos) once asked [Warren Buffett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett), "Your investment thesis is so simple... Why doesn't everyone just copy you?" Buffett's [reply](https://www.beingguru.com/2019/05/warren-buffett-nobody-wants-to-get-rich-slow/) was quite striking:

>**Because nobody wants to get rich slow.**

The most important part of Buffett's strategy is to hold for the long term. He has said that "Our favorite holding period is forever." At its core, the reason why regular investing works is that it is the ideal version of a long-term holding strategy. Most of the time, even Buffett doesn't just buy a target all at once; he enters his position over time. Those who follow the regular investing strategy also **continue to buy at regular intervals over the long term, and hold the asset throughout the process**.

### 1.2 How long is "long-term"

The core of the regular investing strategy is long-term holding. It's well-recognized that the longer you hold the more likely you are to make a profit. But there is a key question we have to answer if we are to have a deeper discussion:

>**How long is "long-term"?**

If we don't have an accurate answer to this question, then we can't even really use the concept of "long-term". For any concept to be useful it must be clearly defined, and since we must combine concepts together, if we have multiple unclear concepts the accuracy of our judgement will be severely impacted, just as multiplying 80% by itself 5 times will leave you us with less than 32%. In course of reading this book, you will encounter several concepts that must be used together, and so they must be clearly and accurately defined in order to be useful.

Unlike most people, I have a fairly clear, accurate and useful definition of long-term:

>Long-term means longer than **two full market cycles**.

A clear and accurate definition of "long-term" thus depends on a clear and accurate definition of another concept: "market cycle". So what's a full market cycle? Let's take Bitcoin's historical price chart as an example to explain.

![Figure05](../images/Figure05.png)

A full market cycle is composed of a period of falling (Period B), and a period of rising (Period A). In this chart we can see a full market cycle, with Period B beginning in December of 2013 when prices started falling, and Period A ending in December of 2017 when Bitcoin reached its historical high. 

How can you tell when a market cycle begins? Actually, we can only make this determination **after the fact**. Since short term prices can rise and fall unpredictably, it's impossible to know when a high or low point for a period has been reached. It's hard to know how long after the fact it will be before we can make the determination, but we can be sure that it will be long enough that the judgement will not be useful for short-term trading decisions.

![Figure06](../images/Figure06.png)

On the same chart, I have market the three full market cycles that I have personally experienced with Bitcoin. The first started around June 8 of 2011 at a price of \$32, and ended on April 11, 2013, at a price of \$266; the second started at the end of the first and ended on December 19, 2013, at a price of \$1,280; the third started at the end of the second and ended on December 17, 2017, at a price of \$19,800. Actually, I have experienced more cycles thin this, since I entered the Bitcoin market two months before the June 2011 high of \$32, and I have continued and will continue to hold Bitcoin since the December 2017 historical high of \$19,800.

The are several details in this chart that are worth looking at closely. For example, we can clearly see, as I mentioned earlier, that bear markets are much, much longer than bull markets. 

Why do we need to emphasize at least **two** market cycles? Because lots of people misunderstand **trends**. They see that today's price is higher than yesterday's, and yesterday's price was higher than the day before, and so they think they have identified an "upward trend". They then erroneously assume that tomorrow's price will be higher than todays. But actually, it's impossible to judge a trend in the short term, even over the course of one entire cycle.

>Only after **two full cycles** can we make an **accurate** judgement about whether a trend is more likely to be upward or downward.

Furthermore, please notice the use of "more likely to be" in the sentence above. Even after two full cycles, we still cannot be 100% sure about the future trend based on historical data. At this point in time (October 2019), Bitcoin's price has still not returned to its historical high, and we cannot be 100% sure that Bitcoin will every exceed its historical high. We will only be able to make this determination after the fact –- long after the fact. In the end, from any point in time, we can only make investment decisions based on less than 100% certainty. Since the future is full of risk and unknown factors, we can only use terms such as "more likely. Actually, this is exactly why investing is so interesting.

In the chart above, we can barely see the high reached in June of 2011. But if we separate each historical high into separate charts, we see that they look strikingly similar.

![Figure07](../images/Figure07.png)

Each of these charts looks quite similar to the overall historical chart, which is to say that even as I am in the midst of my fourth full cycle, even though I have made similar judgments based on "more likely" before, I still can't be completely sure this time. I still can only use "more likely" as the basis for my judgement. It's just that I've been quite lucky in that my previous three judgements based on "more likely" were proven to be correct.

Let's briefly summarize what we have discussed thus far:

> * a period of rising or falling prices does not necessarily constitute a trend –- **it's impossible to determine a trend over the short term**;
> * a period of falling prices (Period B) followed by a period of rising prices (Period A) constitutes a **full cycle**;
> * we can take each **historical high** as the starting point for Period B in a full cycle;
> * we can only determine the historical high of a period **after the fact**;
> * It takes **at least two full cycles** to determine a **trend**;
> * the best we can do is determine that a trend is **more likely**;
> * an upward trend often results in a **new historical high**, but we can only determine high the price goes in a cycle after the fact;
> * long-term holding refers to holding for **at least two full cycles**, or through two bear markets and two bull markets.

If we use this "upgraded" way of thinking to look at any price chart we will get a completely different result than before. Below is the price chart for the S&P 500 from 1956 to 2019:

![Figure08](../images/Figure08.png)

> Note: The historical data in this chart come from [Yahoo Finance (^GSPC)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC), and the chart was created in Google Sheets; you can view the data and spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RsmiifuZajR_POx1zO_--qUcOgwb7tABNQpT-O69Ryk/edit?usp=sharing).

There's an easy way to understand how economic cycles are shaped:

>Economic cycles are shaped by participants in the economy coordinating well at some times and poorly at others.

When many parties -– and many here refers to so many that many parties don't even know the existence of some others -– are communicating more and more efficiently, the length of cycles will become shorter and shorter, even if fluctuations, which occur when parties are not coordinating well, may never be completely eliminated.

If we look at it from this perspective, we can easily understand why the Great Depression in the 1930s took so long to recover from (complete the cycle), yet the recovery from the Asian Financial Crises of the 1990s only took a few years, and the recovery from the worldwide recession brought about by the US subprime crisis was even faster. 

The reason is simple and easily understood:

>The rapid flow of information makes worldwide cooperation easier and more seamless, so even though crises will continue to occur, **recoveries are becoming more rapid.**

This is also why blockchain assets see shorter fluctuation cycles. Over the past eight years, I've often heard people use the halving of Bitcoin's block reward every four years as a way to distinguish Bitcoin's cycles. Maybe that was true early on, but now that Bitcoin is no longer the only valuable blockchain asset, using the block reward halving as a basis for determining cycles has slowly lost significance.

I think that the reason why blockchain asset markets have shorter cycles than stock markets is due to the fact that the players in the market are clearly coordinating more efficiently. We can see this clearly from just looking at the number of trading markets. There are only a few influential stock markets, but there are thousands of markets on which to trade blockchain assets, and trading continues 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This type of coordination greatly exceeds the coordination of traditional securities markets. 

This is truly great news:

>**Cycles are getting shorter and shorter.**

Cycles in stock markets have already shrunk from decades to less than a decade, and they continue to shrink. Blockchain market cycles are already shorter, and the are also shrinking.

In my view, long-term doesn't mean forever, but is a clearly defined concept of two or more full market cycles. In the stock market, two full market cycles will take about 10-15 years; in the blockchain market, two full market cycles will take six to eight years. Either way, they are both futures worth waiting on, right?
