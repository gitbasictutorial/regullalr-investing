# On Regular Investing

*by Xiaolai Li, rewritten in Englisy by John Gordan & Xiaolai Li*

## Warning

While financial trading markets are no doubt the best place where people can make more money by approving their knowledge and cognitions, there’s no other place where people are more severely punished merely because of their poor capacity of critical thinking.

> Investing is risky, lost could be substantial.

As [Howard Stanley Marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Marks_(investor)) once put, who was listed as 327<sup>th</sup> the most wealthy person in United States in 2017:

> “There are *old* investors, and there are *bold* investors, but there are no *old bold* investors.”

Don’t be so naïve as to believe you can turn into superman only because you’ve learnt something new yesterday, translating knowledge into meaninful actions takes much more time than you’ve ever imagined. Relax, take it easy, don’t rush. You can lift a very heavy weight, however, without proper training, it won’t be pretty.

## Preface

It’s been ten years since I published *Befriending Time*, and it’s still a bestseller. While I was writing the book, I tried to follow the following principle:

>*Will this book still be useful to readers in ten years?*

While being bestsellers, my books are often perennial sellers. Here are my secrets for writing a book that continues to sell well over time: **simple**, **direct**, **brutal** and **effective**.

Because I have been writing in this simple, direct, brutal and effective way for so long, I have a deep understanding of the following fact: 

> Solving the single most important problem can directly avoid the problems that so many others face.

Actually, most problems in life are due to failing to resolve the most important problem right from the start. If you can handle the most important problem in the beginning, then even though there will still be many other difficulties, they won’t be those eternal problems that so many people face.

Few are essential decisions in life for which many people also ignore the most important problem. For instance, when choosing whom to marry, “Is she or he reasonable?” is always outside the scope of consideration, even though it is the single most important factor. Instead, they focus on appearance, education, background, etc., without considering which factor will be the most important in the future. Of course, maybe this is because they themselves aren’t a reasonable person (yes, it’s true, most people aren’t very reasonable all the way through their lives). 

Because they haven’t eradicated the most important problem, it sprouts like a seed, growing both a tree above ground and a deep root structure below, creating countless new problems. And so we see the same situation: people surround the “problem tree” above ground, wasting lots of time and energy, trying to find ways to solve those “real” problems, which otherwise don’t exist at all if they made the right decision long time ago, working hard in vain.

Another common yet surprising example is most people’s perception on “success”. *Most people see success as an end* , and this misunderstanding leads to countless new problems that could have been avoided if this mistake had been avoided in the beginning. Success is hard to achieve if we see it as an end point, because we will imbue such a final goal with so many unrealistic hopes and fantasies that we will be unlikely to reach it. Even if some people who take success as an end are lucky enough to reach it, the process will make them abnormal. The craziness that follows success, and the result of that craziness, is actually the result of the mistaken belief from years before that success is an end. 

In fact, success is a new start. If you start a business, this is a new start rather than an end. Each time your business raises money from venture capitals, that is also a new start. Even if you go public, that’s still a new start rather than an end, because you have to continue to help the company grow. In fact, the most tragic failure in life is always from perceiving a new start as an end. 

Investment is also one of few the most important decisions in life, but most people haven’t seriously thought about it, let alone make a decision. The investment arena is divided into two extremes. It’s a binary world in which you’re either a 1 or a 0. Either you are extremely successful, or you are not extremely successful, a mediocre like everybody else, which is basically equal to zero. In my view, the existence of this phenomenon is also related to the fact that most people fail to resolve the most important problem at the start.

So what’s the most important concept in the area of investment? **Long-term**.There are more scams in the investment world than in any other area. Why? Because people who have not deeply understood the important concept of “long-term” are always confronting their “problem tree”. Each leaf on the tree is a “real” problem that they must solve, and each branch is something bigger that they need to think about. Not to mention the roots underground, which are so mysterious that they will never understand. In fact, though, this tree should not even exist.

There is a huge gap between thinking and doing, between knowing and making right dicisions, and long-term practice is the only way to cross this gap. A strategy of **regular investing** is the simplest way to practice investing, as all you have to do is regularly purchase a set investment over the long term. However, simple itself always doesn’t necessarily mean easy.

In Greek mythology, there is an island inhabited by the beautiful Sirens. Their incomparable appearance and voices caused passing sailers to lose their minds and crash into the rocks. Only two heroes were able to safely pass. The first was Orpheus, who played the lyre so beautifully that it drowned out the voices of the sirens. The second was Odysseus, who used wax to plug his sailors’ ears, and ordered them to tie him to the ship’s mast, because he wanted to hear the Siren’s song that he knew he would be unable to resist.

The regular investing strategy is correct, but the target for regular investing should be chosen by the readers themselves. In this book I will provide you the tools to make your own decision about what to invest in, by showing you what I’m regularly investing in, and the reasons behind that choice.

*On Regular Investing* is not only an open-source book, it’s also paired with [BOX](https://b.watch), the first zero-fee digital asset ETF, which is my designed. Regular investing is simple, but not necessarily easy, because it’s as if the boat we are sailing is passing by the island of the Sirens. BOX is like the boat, and those who are investing in BOX with us are like the sailors who need to fill their ears with wax, so I’ll keep teaching lessons in the practice group. And I am like Odysseus, tying myself to the mast. Since there are no fees, the way I make money is simple: like everyone else, I am in the same boat, regularly investing in BOX.

We should solve the most important problem in the very beginning, and not let it take root and grow into a problem tree that gives us a plethora of persistent troubles to deal with. This might be the single most important wisdom in life. 

Before long, you will discover that the strategy of regular investing is not only applicable to investing. Actually, it’s applicable to most of life’s important areas, including study, work, and personal life, where the strategy should be used from the very beginning. 

So again, the reason I am writing this book is because I hope that ten, twenty or even thirty years from now its content will still be useful to a lot of people.
